                  Knowing various programming languages is a no-brainer for engineers, but a basic understanding of the languages
                  can benefit anyone, even if you're not looking to become a master coder. Grasping some general understanding of
                  coding can help you make the right hires for your business needs, communicate better with the engineers on your
